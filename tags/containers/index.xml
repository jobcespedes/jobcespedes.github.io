      <title>A KeyDB Operator</title>

      <description>KeyDB is a multithreading, drop-in alternative to Redis. Keydb-operator easily creates a standalone (1 replica) or a multimaster (3 replicas) KeyDB in-memory database. When KeyDB is in multimaster mode, it is possible to have more than one master, allowing read/write operations to all them. That helps for high availability and fault tolerance.
Install  The Kubernetes Operator in this project is in Alpha version. Use at your own risk

      <title>A Kubernetes NFS Operator</title>

      <description>NFS Operator adds three important features for a NFS in Kubernetes. It allows setting NFS export ownership/permissions, enables PVC autoexpansion and reduces the number of manual resource definitions. It is based on Rook NFS v1.7 and Ansible Operator SDK. Thus, the new features are in addition to those in Rook NFS. The extra functions it adds on top of Rook NFS are:
 It is able to set ownership and permissions for the (NFS) Server export It is able to autoexpand/adjust the value of (NFS) Server PVC storage size It automatically creates a StorageClass with a (NFS) Server  There are some restrictions compared to Rook NFS:</description>

      <title>A Minimal Container Image for Rocky Linux 8</title>

      <description>Now that Rocky Linux is GA, here is a repo for a minimal container image for Rocky Linux. Its size is around ~37 MB (compressed). It is based on Fedora Minimal and UBI8 minimal from Red Hat. You can download it from Quay or build it, following the instructions in the repo. You could also generate a new rootfs yourself before building the image, again, following the short instructions in the repo.</description>

      <title>Simple Testing of Complex Scenarios</title>

      <description>Is there something easy when deploying and configuring the database layer?
Aspects of Data integrity and reliable/safe operations add up to complexity, which only increases when tradicional SQL, high availability, fault tolerance, scalability and high levels of concurrency, are required. It is a sensitive layer, no doubt. Consequently, if there is something easy there, it would be to screw everything up.
Do not fear, go test, screw up and learn. I mean, just not in production.</description>

      <description>I have heard about podman (Pod Manager tool) more and more often now. Whether it is that I have come closer to its developing environment or that it has come to mine, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. It&amp;rsquo;s both, I guess. I use Ansible a lot for automating baremetal and virtual infrastructure: for its definition, deployment, configuration, operation, among other things. In the recent years, I have being using more and more containers, particularly in the developing stages.</description>

      <title>Multiple Environments in Ansible</title>
      <link>https://jobcespedes.dev/2020/02/multiple-environments-in-ansible/</link>

      <description>Many systems are deployed in a multienvironment context, for example: production, stage, and dev. These environments often share variables and artifacts. In Ansible, there are different methods to work in this context. For example, separate directory layout and soft links. However, it can end with a considerable amount of data and duplicate files between environments, exposing variables to all hosts or adding much more complexity to playbooks.
Demo multienv tests a stackable multienvironment directory layout for Ansible, using multienv Ansible role.</description>
