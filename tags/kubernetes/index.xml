The post is meant as a straightforward guide for anyone looking to replicate the process. I hope it proves helpful for your own setup.

It also outlines the steps taken before arriving at that conclusion and presents a list of possible alternatives to achieve a similar result.
Why Fedora CoreOS? The main reasons behind selecting FCOS as the Operating System (OS) were:
Automatic Updates: Fedora CoreOS follows an automated update model, and reboots can also be orchestrated using Zincati.</description></item><item><title>A KeyDB Operator</title><link>https://jobcespedes.dev/2022/01/a-keydb-operator/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jan 2022 23:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jobcespedes.dev/2022/01/a-keydb-operator/</guid><description>KeyDB is a multithreading, drop-in alternative to Redis. The Keydb-operator can easily create either a standalone instance (1 replica) or a multimaster setup (3 replicas) of the KeyDB in-memory database. When KeyDB is in multimaster mode, it is possible to have more than one master, allowing for read/write operations across all of them. This capability enhances high availability and fault tolerance.
This operator is part of the Kubernetes operators and tools developed by Krestomatio, a managed service for Moodle™ instances</description></item><item><title>A Kubernetes NFS Operator</title><link>https://jobcespedes.dev/2021/07/a-kubernetes-nfs-operator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 13:55:42 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jobcespedes.dev/2021/07/a-kubernetes-nfs-operator/</guid><description>NFS Operator creates NFSv4 ganesha servers in Kubernetes, allowing to set ownership/permissions of their NFS export directory; to autoexpand their PVC; and to enable RWX storage from them:
It can set ownership and permissions for export parent directory of the (NFS) Ganesha server. It is able to expand/adjust the PVC size of the (NFS) Ganesha server automatically, as it grows. It could autogenerate an StorageClass that uses the (NFS) Ganesha server for RWX storage.</description></item><item><title>A Minimal Container Image for Rocky Linux 8</title><link>https://jobcespedes.dev/2021/06/a-minimal-container-image-for-rocky-linux-8/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 18:55:42 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jobcespedes.dev/2021/06/a-minimal-container-image-for-rocky-linux-8/</guid><description>Now that Rocky Linux is GA, here is a repo for a minimal container image for Rocky Linux. Its size is around ~37 MB (compressed). It is based on Fedora Minimal and UBI8 minimal from Red Hat. You can download it from Quay or build it, following the instructions in the repo. You could also generate a new rootfs yourself before building the image, again, following the short instructions in the repo.</description></item></channel></rss>
