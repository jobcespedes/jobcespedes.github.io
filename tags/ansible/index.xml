      <title>Simple Testing of Complex Scenarios</title>

      <description>Is there something easy when deploying and configuring the database layer?
Aspects of Data integrity and reliable/safe operations add up to complexity, which only increases when tradicional SQL, high availability, fault tolerance, scalability and high levels of concurrency, are required. It is a sensitive layer, no doubt. Consequently, if there is something easy there, it would be to screw everything up.
Do not fear, go test, screw up and learn. I mean, just not in production.</description>

      <description>I have heard about podman (Pod Manager tool) more and more often now. Whether it is that I have come closer to its developing environment or that it has come to mine, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. It&amp;rsquo;s both, I guess. I use Ansible a lot for automating baremetal and virtual infrastructure: for its definition, deployment, configuration, operation, among other things. In the recent years, I have being using more and more containers, particularly in the developing stages.</description>

      <title>Multiple Environments in Ansible</title>

      <description>Many systems are deployed in a multienvironment context, for example: production, stage, and dev. These environments often share variables and artifacts. In Ansible, there are different methods to work in this context. For example, separate directory layout and soft links. However, it can end with a considerable amount of data and duplicate files between environments, exposing variables to all hosts or adding much more complexity to playbooks.
Demo multienv tests a stackable multienvironment directory layout for Ansible, using multienv Ansible role.</description>
